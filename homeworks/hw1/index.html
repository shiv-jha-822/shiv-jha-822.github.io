        <p>Hey, I'm Shiv, a CS student at UC Berkeley. In my free time, I like to hang out with my friends or watch football and basketball. 
            I also like learning new skills like juggling. Looking forward to learning more about web design. My favorite places to eat in Berkeley are:</p>

            <li>Xpression</li>
            <li>Thai Basil</li>
            <li>Delhi Diner</li>
        </ul>

             <ul>
                <li>You can learn a lot just by studying apps that already exist. Looking at apps today can help inspire your own design choices.</li>
                <li>I think the part where the design of Airbnb is analyzed is cool because I started to understand more about design/marketing choices. 
                    I like how the author went into details about different aspects of the app.</li>
                <li>I’m sure many designs have gone through explorations where the Dates aren’t 
                    presented until you select a location. This makes me curious about how people search and when they introduce filters to their searches.</li>
